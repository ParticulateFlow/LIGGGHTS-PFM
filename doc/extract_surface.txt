extract_surface command :h3

[Syntax:]

extract_surface inputfile file surfacefile extrusionfile extrude_length l min_rad r mode :pre

inputfile = filename of VTK grid data :ulb,l
file = obligatory keyword :l
surfacefile = filename to write surface VTK data :l
optional extrusion args :l
  extrusionfile = filename to write extruded surface VTK data
  extrude_length = obligatory keyword
  l = total height of extruded volume
  min_rad = obligatory keyword
  r = distance volume is extruded outwards :pre
mode = output file mode {ascii} or {binary} (optional) :l
:ule

[Examples:]

extract_surface data/grid.vtk file data/surface.vtk data/extrusion.vtk extrude_length 0.1 min_rad 0.025 :pre

[Description:]

Given an unstructured grid VTK file consisting of hexahedral cells,
this command will extract and triangulate the surface and save it to
an unstructured grid VTK file adding a unique ID for each cell face
(i.e. typically two triangles). Furthermore, the surface thus obtained
may be used to create a shell geometry extruding the surface {l-r} distance
units inwards and {r} distance units outwards. If used as insertion volume
for multi-level coarse-grain simulations, {r} should be set to the minimum
particle radius occuring in the simulation. The total extrusion length {l}
should be about 2 particle diameters but is ultimately determined by
the insertion rate and the velocity of the particles.

[Restrictions:]

none

[Default:]

mode = ascii
