fix execute command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID execute N string keyword :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
execute = style name of this fix command :l
N = execute every N steps :l
string = text string to be executed with optional variable names :l
keyword = none or {once} or {conditional} or {file} :l
{conditional} value = variable name, target value, tolerance
    variable name = variable that triggers execution, needs to be defined beforehand in the input script
    target value = value of variable at which fix is executed
    tolerance = how much the value of the variable and the target value may differ :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

fix ex0 all execute 100 "variable a equal $x"
fix ex1 all execute 100 "variable a equal $x" once
fix ex2 all execute 100 "variable a equal $x" conditional trigger 10.0 0.1
fix ex3 all execute 100 "../DEM/in.subfunctions" file :pre

[Description:]

Executes a text string as LIGGGHTS command every N steps during a simulation run. This can
be used for coupled simulations that would otherwise only take a given number of timesteps. If the "once" keyword is specified,
the command is executed only once at time step N. The "conditional" keyword allows to specify a variable which triggers the execution of the fix if it holds the desired value. If the "file" keyword is present, LIGGGHTS looks for an input script with the name of the string to be executed.
