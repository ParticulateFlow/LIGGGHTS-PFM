fix remove command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID remove nevery N massrate massrate_value style style_value \[delete_below delete_below_value\] seed seed_value keyword value ... :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
remove = style name of this fix command :l
nevery = obligatory keyword :l
N = remove particles every this many timesteps :l
massrate = obligatory keyword :l
massrate_value = rate at which to remove particles :l
massratevariable = alternative keyword to massrate :l
massrate_name = name of variable with which to remove particles :l
style = obligatory keyword :l
style_value = {shrink} or {delete} :l
delete_below = obligatory keyword if style_value is {shrink} :l
delete_below_value = radius below which particles are removed if style_value is {shrink} :l
seed = obligatory keyword :l
seed_value = random # seed (positive integer) :l
zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l
keywords = {region} or {atomtype} or {integrated_error} or {minmass} or {restart_read} or {restart_write} or {verbose} or {compress} :l
  {region} value = region-ID
    region-ID = ID of the region where the particles will be removed
  {atomtype} value = type
    type = type of atoms to remove
  {integrated_error} value = {yes} or {no}
  {minmass} value = minimal mass to be removed at once
  {restart_read} value = {yes} or {no}
  {restart_write} value = {yes} or {no}
  {verbose} value = {yes} or {no}
  {compress} value = {yes} or {no} :pre

[Examples:]

fix 1 all remove nevery 500 massrate 3.5 style delete seed 5143 region del_region atomtype 1
fix 1 all remove nevery 500 massrate 3.5 style shrink delete_below 0.001 seed 7543 region del_region
fix 1 all remove nevery 500 massratevariable removal_rate style delete seed 2137 integrated_error no :pre

[Description:]

Remove atoms from the simulation at the specified rate.

For style {delete}, all atoms belonging to the group are deleted immediately.

For style {shrink}, atoms belonging to the group are shrunk and get deleted only
if their radius is smaller than the value set via {delete_below}.

The region from which particles are removed can be specified using the {region}
keyword.

The {atomtype} option allows to restrict deletion to a single type of atoms.

The {integrated_error} option (default yes) accumulates the mass to be removed over time and subtracts the actually removed mass. If disabled, mass
is removed proportionally to the removal rate.

The {minmass} option allows to specify a minimal value (default 1e-6) for the mass to be removed at once. 

The {verbose} keyword controls whether statistics about particle
removal is output to the screen each time particles are removed.

The {restart} options (default true) determine whether the fix reads and/or writes restart information.

If the {compress} keyword is set to {yes}, then after atoms are
removed, the atom IDs are re-assigned so that they run from 1 to the
number of atoms in the system. This is not done for molecular systems
(see the "atom_style"_atom_style.html command), regardless of the
{compress} setting, since it would foul up the bond connectivity that
has already been assigned.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

If {restart_write} is not disabled, information about the state of this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  None of the "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options
are relevant to this fix.  No global or per-atom quantities are stored
by this fix for access by various "output commands"_Section_howto.html#howto_15.
No parameter of this fix can be used with the {start/stop} keywords of the
"run"_run.html command.
This fix is not invoked during "energy minimization"_minimize.html.

[Restrictions:]

Style {shrink} is not supported for multisphere particles

[Related commands:]

[Default:]

The option defaults are verbose = no and compress = yes
