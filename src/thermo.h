/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running LAMMPS to see the offending line.

E: Could not find thermo compute ID

Compute ID specified in thermo_style command does not exist.

E: Could not find thermo fix ID

Fix ID specified in thermo_style command does not exist.

E: Thermo and fix not computed at compatible times

Fixes generate values on specific timesteps.  The thermo output
does not match these timesteps.

E: Could not find thermo variable name

Self-explanatory.

E: Too many total atoms

See the setting for bigint in the src/lmptype.h file.

E: Lost atoms: original %ld current %ld

Lost atoms are checked for each time thermo output is done.  See the
thermo_modify lost command for options.  Lost atoms usually indicate
bad dynamics, e.g. atoms have been blown far out of the simulation
box, or moved futher than one processor's sub-domain away before
reneighboring.

W: Lost atoms: original %ld current %ld

Lost atoms are checked for each time thermo output is done.  See the
thermo_modify lost command for options.  Lost atoms usually indicate
bad dynamics, e.g. atoms have been blown far out of the simulation
box, or moved futher than one processor's sub-domain away before
reneighboring.

E: Thermo style does not use temp

Cannot use thermo_modify to set this parameter since the thermo_style
is not computing this quantity.

E: Could not find thermo_modify temperature ID

The compute ID needed by thermo style custom to compute temperature does
not exist.

E: Thermo_modify temperature ID does not compute temperature

The specified compute ID does not compute temperature.

W: Temperature for thermo pressure is not for group all

User-assigned temperature to thermo via the thermo_modify command does
not compute temperature for all atoms.  Since thermo computes a global
pressure, the kinetic energy contribution from the temperature is
assumed to also be for all atoms.  Thus the pressure printed by thermo
could be inaccurate.

E: Pressure ID for thermo does not exist

The compute ID needed to compute pressure for thermodynamics does not
exist.

E: Thermo style does not use press

Cannot use thermo_modify to set this parameter since the thermo_style
is not computing this quantity.

E: Could not find thermo_modify pressure ID

The compute ID needed by thermo style custom to compute pressure does
not exist.

E: Thermo_modify pressure ID does not compute pressure

The specified compute ID does not compute pressure.

E: Thermo_modify int format does not contain d character

Self-explanatory.

E: Could not find thermo custom compute ID

The compute ID needed by thermo style custom to compute a requested
quantity does not exist.

E: Thermo compute does not compute scalar

Self-explanatory.

E: Thermo compute does not compute vector

Self-explanatory.

E: Thermo compute vector is accessed out-of-range

Self-explanatory.

E: Thermo compute does not compute array

Self-explanatory.

E: Thermo compute array is accessed out-of-range

Self-explanatory.

E: Could not find thermo custom fix ID

The fix ID needed by thermo style custom to compute a requested
quantity does not exist.

E: Thermo fix does not compute scalar

Self-explanatory.

E: Thermo fix does not compute vector

Self-explanatory.

E: Thermo fix vector is accessed out-of-range

Self-explanatory.

E: Thermo fix does not compute array

Self-explanatory.

E: Thermo fix array is accessed out-of-range

Self-explanatory.

E: Could not find thermo custom variable name

Self-explanatory.

E: Thermo custom variable is not equal-style variable

Only equal-style variables can be output with thermodynamics, not
atom-style variables.

E: Thermo custom variable cannot be indexed

Self-explanatory.

E: Invalid keyword in thermo_style custom command

One or more specified keywords are not recognized.

E: This variable thermo keyword cannot be used between runs

Keywords that refer to time (such as cpu, elapsed) do not
make sense in between runs.

E: Thermo keyword in variable requires thermo to use/init temp

You are using a thermo keyword in a variable that requires temperature
to be calculated, but your thermo output does not use it.  Add it to
your thermo output.

E: Compute used in variable thermo keyword between runs is not current

Some thermo keywords rely on a compute to calculate their value(s).
Computes cannot be invoked by a variable in between runs.  Thus they
must have been evaluated on the last timestep of the previous run in
order for their value(s) to be accessed.  See the doc page for the
variable command for more info.

E: Thermo keyword in variable requires thermo to use/init press

You are using a thermo keyword in a variable that requires pressure to
be calculated, but your thermo output does not use it.  Add it to your
thermo output.

E: Thermo keyword in variable requires thermo to use/init pe

You are using a thermo keyword in a variable that requires
potential energy to be calculated, but your thermo output
does not use it.  Add it to your thermo output.

E: Energy was not tallied on needed timestep

You are using a thermo keyword that requires potentials to
have tallied energy, but they didn't on this timestep.  See the
variable doc page for ideas on how to make this work.

U: Thermo keyword requires lattice be defined

The xlat, ylat, zlat keywords refer to lattice properties.

U: Thermo keyword in variable requires lattice be defined

The xlat, ylat, zlat keywords refer to lattice properties.
